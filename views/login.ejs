The login form is a simple form within a container that submits a POST request to the route /login
It contains 2 field's, username and password, and a button that submits the form.

It again uses Bootstrap classes to style certain aspects, for example, a typography class is used to
centralise the h1, and a form class is used to group the labels and inputs for the form.
